== Description ==

Once you've created an account with Wink, you can install this WordPress plugin on your site. Once installed, the plugin will ask you for your clientId and secretKey to connect with your account on Wink. 

Once you've entered your credentials, you can go to your Gutenberg editor and start embedding our web components into your site.

Available components:

* [winklookup]: Works with ranked content grid. Type in a place you want to visit and have inventory displayed.
* [winksearch]: Simple button to open up itinerary form.
* [winkaccount]Account: Button to let you authenticate. Once authenticated, it turns into a dropdown with account options.
* [winkitinerary]Itinerary: Same as search button, only it contains itinerary information as button text.
* [winkcontent]: Lets you embed the inventory you've selected on Wink directly into a page or post.
